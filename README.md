### Customizing

#### Items (Slides)

By default, each slide will be rendered as passed as children. If you need to customize them, use the prop `renderItem`.

```
renderItem: (item: React.ReactNode, options?: { isSelected: boolean }) => React.ReactNode;
```

#### Thumbs

By default, thumbs are generated extracting the images in each slide. If you don't have images on your slides or if you prefer a different thumbnail, use the method `renderThumbs` to return a new list of images to be used as thumbs.

```
renderThumbs: (children: React.ReactChild[]) => React.ReactChild[]
```

#### Arrows

By default, simple arrows are rendered on each side. If you need to customize them and the css is not enough, use the `renderArrowPrev` and `renderArrowNext`. The click handler is passed as argument to the prop and needs to be added as click handler in the custom arrow.

```
renderArrowPrev: (clickHandler: () => void, hasPrev: boolean, label: string) => React.ReactNode;
renderArrowNext: (clickHandler: () => void, hasNext: boolean, label: string) => React.ReactNode;
```

#### Indicators

By default, indicators will be rendered as those small little dots in the bottom part of the carousel. To customize them, use the `renderIndicator` prop.

```
renderIndicator: (
    clickHandler: (e: React.MouseEvent | React.KeyboardEvent) => void,
    isSelected: boolean,
    index: number,
    label: string
) => React.ReactNode;
```

#### Take full control of the carousel

If none of the previous options are enough, you can build your own controls for the carousel. Check an example at http://react-responsive-carousel.js.org/storybook/?path=/story/02-advanced--with-external-controls

### Videos

If your carousel is about videos, keep in mind that it's up to you to control which videos will play. Using the `renderItem` prop, you will get information saying if the slide is selected or not and can use that to change the video state. Only play videos on selected slides to avoid issues. Check an example at http://react-responsive-carousel.js.org/storybook/?path=/story/02-advanced--youtube-autoplay-with-custom-thumbs
